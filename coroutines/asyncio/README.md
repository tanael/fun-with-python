# Fun with python coroutines - asyncio

The preferred way of writing `asyncio` applications using `async`/`await`.

## Sample `simple.py`

A simple demonstration of `asyncio`, rather useless...

## Sample `sequential.py`

A sequential implementation of `asyncio`, still useless...

## Sample `asynchronous.py`

A truly asynchronous implementation of `asyncio`, at last!
