# Fun with python coroutines

Cool and useful pythonic code regarding `coroutines`.

## Coroutines

### Definition

A `coroutine` is a subroutine that can be paused and resumed.

### First sample: `coroutine.py`

A simple program demonstrating how a `coroutine` in python is just a
`generator`.

### Second sample: `piped_coroutines.py`

A simple program demonstrating how `coroutines` can be piped together, from a
`producer` function to a final `sink` `coroutine`.

## Futures

A "behind the scenes" view of how asynchronous programming is done in python.

## Asyncio

The preferred way of writing `asyncio` applications using `async`/`await`.
